        if not more so, in the company I joined. 
        I honestly feel i got every penny's worth </p>
      <p class="quote-minor">"I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. 
        I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
        I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly there after. 
        The next 12 weeks was the best and most gruelling-time of my life. 
        Since completing the course. I've successfully switched carreers,
         working as software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

      <p class="quote-major">Such a life-changing experience. highly recommended!</p>
      <p class="quote-minor">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. 
        I needed some structures from proffessionals, who can help me learn programming step by step.
         I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
         The entire curriculum and staffs did not disappoint. 
         They were  very hands-on and I never had to Wait long for assistance.
         The agile team project in Particular was outstanding.
          it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
         In fact I've often referred to it during interviews as an example my development experience. 
         It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stock developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!</p>
